Stahp It is a transparent HTTP/S Content Filter that uses Adblock Plus filters and CSS selectors, for Windows Vista and later. Using Stahp It, it's possible to filter HTTP requests made by any process on your device. 

Stahp It also detectes HTML payloads in HTTP responses, parses them, and removes elements by using user provided CSS selectors before returning the content. So it's possible to not just filter requests, but modify the content returned by those requests.

Put simply, Stahp It gives users complete control over all HTTP traffic. By its nature, every single browser that exists today is supported, and any browser in the future would automatically be supported. This is because Stahp It resides at the packet level, sitting atop the hardware, gaining automatic precedence.

In fact any process of any kind that does HTTP/S communication is supported, so you can filter web content that otherwise escapes other blockers (looking at you Windows 8/8.1/10 and the ads you ~~inject~~ used to inject into my shell).
